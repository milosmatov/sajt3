<p><font size="5"><img src="illustration-kids-studying-classroom-260nw-107303768.jpg" width="200" height="200">He started elementary school at the age of seven and had a strict teacher 
until the fifth grade. At the beginning of his education, he was not a very good student. 
He was always pass with Bâ€™s. He got acquainted with the English language in the third grade 
of elementary school. He went to private lessons with a professor of Serbian language and literature, 
who taught private English lessons for young students. The same teacher taught him the Serbian-Croatian 
language, as it was then called, in the older classes. Today it is only the Serbian language. 
In the fifth grade, there was a mixing of classes and there were no longer the same students
 in the class as in the fourth grade. From the fifth to the eighth grade he was an excellent
 student, with all A's, which the teacher didn't believe until she went and saw for herself what
 kind of grades he had. In eighth grade, it gets tough. He was in love until then, but bad things 
 happened in the state itself. We were under sanctions where the whole country was isolated from 
 the world. We also had hyperinflation and a shortage of even bread. He then gave up in school.

Even after one 
 game played on the field where he and the team trained, it was said that no one had played a better 
 game in who knows how many years. There he was proposed for the first team, but for some, who knows 
 what reason, that idea was not implemented. As mentioned, he had a love in the seventh grade and it
 was a new student, who came from North Macedonia, but maybe everything was too early, so that 
 relationship failed. Today they are good friends. Although he was a good student during elementary 
 school, he also liked to joke with teachers and students in class, so he was often warned that he 
 could not behave like that. Once he went too far with a joke and the class teacher beat him in 
 front of all the students. He most likely deserved those beatings.</font></p>
