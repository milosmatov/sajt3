 Father Miodrag and mother Milinka are the people who brought him into this world with joy. 
 Living relatives include his aunt and his aunt's brother, who were born in Čačak and live 
 further away from him, where he is now settled. His maternal grandmother took care of him and his 
 sister. Ljubić the most, the village is close, it almost belongs to the city center, but it was on a
 hill where there is a nice view of the city panorama. Grandma passed away in 2000. and on a church
 holiday celebrated by doctors in Serbia. Every New Year, his sister and he received packages from
 Santa and there were lots of sweets and some toys. As a child before elementary school,
 he was very mischievous and even liked to fight, of course, only with his hands.

 which he later shared with his friends who were not so brave as to climb so high on the tree. 
 Summer was reserved for the sea, where they went to a resort that belonged to Elektrodistribucija 
 Čačak in Bečići most often, and during the eighties of the twentieth century they spent fifteen days
 there. The winter was spent on Kopaonik, a mountain in Serbia, where he and his sister learned to ski
 on the Mali Karaman track, but also on Pančićev vrh.
